# EarthCam Feed Scraping Project

## Overview

This project scrapes live camera feeds from EarthCam, extracting details such as thumbnails, feed titles, locations, views, and likes. The results are presented in an HTML format for easy viewing.


## Project Structure
```
stream-capture/
├── dist/
│   └── scrape_earthcam (or scrape_earthcam.exe on Windows)
├── template.html
├── scrape_earthcam.spec
├── scrape_earthcam.py
├── README.md
└── requirements.txt
```

- **`dist/`**: Contains the standalone executable file that can be run without needing Python installed.
- **`template.html`**: The Jinja2 template used to generate the final HTML output.
- **`scrape_earthcam.spec`**: Configuration file generated by PyInstaller.
- **`scrape_earthcam.py`**: The main Python script that performs the web scraping and HTML generation.
- **`README.md`**: This documentation file.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists the Python dependencies (not needed if using the executable).

## Requirements

If you are using the executable file, you do not need to install any dependencies or set up Python. Simply run the executable file provided.

## How to Run the Project

### Using the Executable File

1. **Download the Project Files**:
    - Extract the contents of the ZIP file if needed.

2. **Run the Executable**:
    - Navigate to the `dist/` directory.
    - Double-click on `scrape_earthcam` (or `scrape_earthcam.exe` on Windows) to run the application.
    
3. **View the Results**:
    - After running the executable, a file named `earthcam_feeds.html` will be generated in the project directory.
    - Open this HTML file in any web browser to view the scraped data.

### Running the Script (Advanced Users)

If you prefer to run the Python script directly (and have Python installed), follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**:
    - Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
    - Install the required Python libraries using:
      ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```

2. **Run the Script**:
    - Execute the script using:
      ```bash
      python scrape_earthcam.py
      ```

3. **View the Results**:
    - After running the script, a file named `earthcam_feeds.html` will be generated.
    - Open this HTML file in any web browser to view the results.

## Output Details

- **HTML Output**: The generated `earthcam_feeds.html` file contains a grid of the scraped EarthCam feeds. Each feed includes:
  - Thumbnail image
  - Feed title
  - Location
  - Views count
  - Likes count
  - A link to view the live feed

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- **Automation**: The script could be set up to run automatically at scheduled intervals.
- **Additional Data Sources**: More feeds or different sources could be added to expand the project.
- **Web Application**: Convert the project into a web application for easier access and broader use.

## Troubleshooting

- **Executable Not Running**:
  - Ensure you have the necessary permissions to run the file.
  - On macOS, you may need to grant permission to run the executable through System Preferences.

- **Data Not Loading in HTML**:
  - Ensure that the script was able to scrape the data correctly. Check the console output for any error messages.
